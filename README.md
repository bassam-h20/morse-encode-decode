### morse.py uses two main functions (1) encode and (2) decode which both convert characters and symbols to morse code and vice versa

* When the program is run it prints out the binary tree used to decode the morse code in the decode function.

* And then gives the user the option to (E) encode or (D) decode, and enter the characters accordingly 


### Task 2 was to implement the two functions mentioned and make sure they work properly, and that can be seen through the image below
